        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>I started getting into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and Programming during my Freshman and Sophmore years of high school. My learning started with different programming books and online classes. I got more and more interested and then during my Senior year in high school I started taking a Intro to Computer Science Class using Python and I am currently in a Web Design Class using HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>I have learned <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, HTML, CSS, Java, and have a little bit of experience with Java Script. These languages are very helpful to what I want to do in the future.</p>

        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>This is another parapgraph for my second assessment in <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/lps.k12.co.us/ahscs2js/" target="_blank">Web Design</a> Class. I am very confused on external style sheets because I missed Tuesday. </p>
